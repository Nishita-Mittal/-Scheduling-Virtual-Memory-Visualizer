## 📌 Features

### ✅ CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SJF (Shortest Job First)
- Round Robin
- Priority Scheduling

### ✅ Virtual Memory Management:
- Page Replacement Algorithms: LRU, FIFO, Optimal
- Visual representation of page hits and page faults
- Frame table updates with each memory access

### ✅ General Features:
- Easy-to-use GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- Input custom processes or memory references
- Live tracking of time, queues, memory pages
